I don't complie my own kernel. And the debug configs diff between 2.6.x and 4.x versions.

I try write a module named "printk", but failed to insmod. Then I change the name "printktest", It's ok.
%i -- signed int
%p -- original pointer(the address)

The 8 loglevel macro is not defined in <linux/kernel.h>, but <linux/kern_levels.h>.
The DEFUALT_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL can't be found in <linux/printk.c>. (the printk.c can't be found either) The default level is warning, I test for this result.

*[p95]
fedora25 no klogd & syslogd. I can't understand console log output sth.
If I insmod/rmmod module in terminal ( ctrl + alt + F5 ), I can see the message in the screen. And the default message level is 0-3, because the /proc/sys/kernel/printk is "4 x x x".
The offical example setlevel.c is out-of-date now. Because "Starting  around  kernel  2.6.18,  the  _syscall  macros  were  removed from header files supplied to user space.  Use syscall(2) instead." from `man 2 _syscall`. And the right way is in my setlevel.c . Don't forget to run "setlevel" by root.

*[p96]
setconsole ignored.
"How Messages Get Logged" almost can't understand.

*[p98]
debug method: useful but I haven't write sth for it. Try in later program.

*[p100]
use printk_ratelimit() to limit the rate of printk.

*[p100]
print_dev_t
format_dev_t 
Try later.
